                                Your task is to design your own art gallery or museum. Imagine that you're the decision-maker, responsible for
                                everything from its appearance to its purpose and audience.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                If you're unsure where to begin, consider a museum or gallery you've visited. Reflect on how you felt upon entering,
                                what you remember about the experience, and what impressions it left on you.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Think about the purpose of your gallery. Is it to showcase a specific type of art, to provide an educational
                                experience, or to be a place for art appreciation and exploration? Your design should reflect this purpose and
                                create an environment that encourages visitors to engage with the art in a meaningful way.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Also, consider the audience for your gallery. Who will be visiting? What are their interests and expectations? How
                                can you cater to these needs and preferences?
                            </p>
